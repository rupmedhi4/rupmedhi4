# 👋 Hi, I'm Rup Jyoti Medhi!

I'm a passionate **MERN Stack Developer** from Assam, India. I love building dynamic, full-stack web applications using **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. I am constantly learning and refining my skills, with a focus on delivering clean and efficient code.

## 👀 Interests
- 🔥 I'm deeply interested in full-stack development, especially the MERN stack.
- 📈 Eager to grow my knowledge in backend technologies, particularly in **Node.js**.
- 💻 Passionate about learning from the **ISKCON** philosophy, which inspires me to always work with dedication and humility, much like how a web application serves its users selflessly.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- 🚀 Diving deep into **Node.js** to strengthen my backend skills.
- 🔍 Exploring real-time communication systems using **Socket.io**.
